## Reflection

  - I want a to build on top of showdown a editor with more user friendly features
  - The basic implementation is for desktop only 
  - the project makes use of the following project/tools :
      - Parcel, react, showdown, jest, typescript 
      - for css i started with no framework in mind, but tailwind is a good candidate when more features will come in.
